# Techsenger ShellFX

Techsenger ShellFX is a platform for building JavaFX applications, where an application is structured
as a tree of MVP components, each of which has its own lifecycle, history, etc. The platform provides abstract
classes for creating the main types of components: window, tab, area, page, dialog, and popup.

It also includes ready-to-use implementations of containers (including a docking layout) and dialogs (including a
universal file chooser). In addition, the platform provides powerful devtools that allow you to inspect both the MVP
component tree and the underlying JavaFX scene graph. These tools make it easy to understand how the platform works
and are invaluable during development.

ShellFX is built around two core subsystems: the dynamic main menu and the workspace. The main menu is assembled
at runtime and automatically adapts to the currently focused component. The workspace provides the structural
foundation of the application and defines how components are arranged and interact visually. The platform supports
different types of workspace models.

`ShellFX` is built according to the KISS principle. We aimed to keep it as simple as possible — with no magic and
no overly complex solutions. For example, the platform is based on a slightly extended classic MVP pattern and provides
components for the core parts of an application, such as windows, tabs, dialogs, and others. The main idea was to
allow developers to start working with the platform within a single day, and we believe this goal has been achieved.

ShellFX is built on top of the [PatternFX](https://github.com/techsenger/patternfx) framework.

* Window styling that matches the theme.
* Support for 7 themes (4 dark and 3 light).
* API for working with all colors in the palettes of all themes
* Styling with CSS.

## When to Use <a name="when-to-use"></a>

ShellFX is well suited for medium to large JavaFX applications that require a structured UI architecture and
flexible workspace management.

It is particularly effective for projects that:

- Rely on a component-based MVP architecture.
- Contain multiple tabs or require complex workspace layouts (including docking-based layouts).
- Need dynamic menus, theming support, and centralized shell-level infrastructure.
- Benefit from built-in DevTools for inspecting both the component tree and the JavaFX scene graph.

ShellFX provides a scalable foundation for applications where UI complexity grows over time and clear structural
boundaries are essential.

Typical application types include:

- Enterprise systems managing different data entities.
- Code editors and lightweight IDEs.
- Database and query tools.
- File managers and content browsers.
- Monitoring and analytics dashboards.
- Tools that require parallel workflows within multiple tabs or panels.

The tab-based approach allows users to maintain workflow context while switching between different tasks, making
complex applications more intuitive and productive.

## Modules<a name="modules"></a>

The platform consists of the following modules:

* Material — provides UI elements (menus, text areas, etc.) and supporting classes.
* Core — includes the shell itself, base classes for component development, settings, and core utility classes.
* Layout — offers abstract components for creating tabs with various layouts.
* Shared — includes components that are used by other components from different modules.
* Icons — contains the Material Design Icons font and module-specific stylesheets that utilize these icons. To use
custom icons instead, simply create your own stylesheets and add them to Shell.
* Storage — provides abstractions for working with file systems. The module includes a default implementation for the
local file system. Additional storage providers (for Google Drive, Dropbox, FTP, and similar) can be implemented
separately.
* Dialogs — provides ready-to-use dialogs: alert, file chooser, confirmation etc.
* DevTools — contains tools for exploring component tree and JavaFX scene graph.
* Demo — showcases ShellFX's core functionality, provides examples for building custom components, and
presents ready-made components.

## Core Components <a name="core"></a>

These components form the architectural foundation of the platform, and all higher-level platform components are built
upon them.

ShellFX is built on top of the PatternFX platform, which supports working both with and without a component tree.
In ShellFX, all components form a tree structure, and multiple trees may exist depending on the number of `Window`s.
For this reason, all ShellFX core components inherit from the `Parent` and `Child` components provided by PatternFX.

Each component is defined by an interface accompanied by a base implementation. This approach ensures loose coupling
while still providing default implementations out of the box. It also allows developers to replace or extend the default
behavior with custom implementations when required. For instance, the platform consistently references `Shell`
through the `ShellFxView` interface rather than a concrete class.

When working with components, there are several important points to keep in mind:

1. The developer must control the component lifecycle. Component initialization is performed either manually or in
the `open*` or `show*` methods of `Composer`, which may delegate this logic to `create*` methods (using `create*`
methods makes it easy to replace the component being created). Component deinitialization is performed either manually
or in the `close*` or `hide*` methods of `Composer`. See [Naming Convention](#naming-convention) for details.

2. Working with components involves maintaining two hierarchies — the component tree and the JavaFX scene graph.
Therefore, any addition or removal of a component must be reflected in both structures. For example, removing a component
from the node tree without removing it from the component tree will result in a memory leak. DevTools provide the ability
to inspect and monitor both hierarchies.

### Shell <a name="core-shell"></a>

`Shell` is the main and top-level component. It extends the `HostWindow` component and inherits its responsibilities for
managing the JavaFX `Stage` and window-level infrastructure. In addition, `Shell` defines the primary application
structure and user experience layer.

It is responsible for the following tasks:

* Dynamic menu management.
* Workspace management.
* Context management.

The Shell core does not contain any business logic. It is only a shell for other components that contain logic.

Working with the main menu of the `Shell` is carried out in two directions:

1. Configuring menu elements
2. Managing the state of elements and responding to user actions

The configuration of menu elements is performed dynamically and in any order, with the final result being unknown in
advance. This feature is crucial in cases where plugins/extensions are used, as they can be added/removed dynamically by
the user. Each plugin may introduce its own menu items and interact with existing menus. Therefore, it is impossible
to predict the final structure of the menu that the user will work with.

The implementation of this feature is structured around the `ControlRegistry` (see
[ControlRegistry](#registries-control)). Factories for the three key elements—the menu, the group, and the item
(see [Managed Menu](#managed-controls-menu)) are registered with and unregistered from the `ControlRegistry`. When
the menu needs to be updated, `Shell` uses `ControlBuilder` to read the registry and construct the final menu.

A menu consists of groups separated by separators. Items are added to groups, and empty groups are ignored. Each menu
and group has its own name, which is used for identification. The `MenuBarManager` is responsible for managing the state
of menu elements and responding to their actions. It interacts with a component that provides a port implementing the
`MenuAwarePort` interface.

The algorithm works as follows. First, the component that has focus is determined. The `Shell` tracks changes to
the focused node using `Scene#focusOwnerProperty()`. When this property changes, the component that owns the node is
identified, and the result is stored in `ShellFxView#focusedProperty()`. Note that if a component should become focused
when the user clicks on an empty area of that component (for example, a `Pane`), you must explicitly call
`pane.requestFocus()`.

At the same time, the focused component may not participate in menu formation (for example, it could be just a toolbar).
Therefore, after the focused component changes, `Shell` searches from the focused component up to the root of the
tree — the Shell — for the first component whose port implements `MenuAwarePort`. Note that `Shell` can also form
the main menu, but this is usually done only when the workspace is empty. See also `ShellFxView#menuAwareProperty()`.

It is also important to remember that the `MenuBarManager` also interacts with `MenuAwarePort` when the user uses
accelerators.

To gain a complete understanding of working with the menu, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with the
`MenuAwarePort` interface, experiment with the menu in the demo, and pay attention to log messages at the debug level.

The second key part of ShellFX is the workspace, which represents one of the available layouts. ShellFX supports
different types of workspace:

1. Browser-like. This workspace is created using the `TabHost` component with a flag indicating that it is a workspace.
Additionally, the tabs added to this `TabHost` contain a docking layout created with the `DockHost` component.
2. IDE-like. This workspace is a straightforward docking layout created with the `DockHost` component.

### Window <a name="core-window"></a>

`Window` is one of the core components of the platform and is available in two variants: `WindowType#NESTED` and
`WindowType#TOP_LEVEL`.

`NESTED` windows are internal windows managed by `WindowManager`. `WindowManager` allows an unlimited number of
windows to be opened simultaneously, tracks the active window, manages window state, and provides various window
arrangement operations such as cascade, tile, and others.

The platform provides two implementations of window hosts: `HostWindow` and `HostTab`. This allows nested windows
to be displayed either inside another window or inside a tab. The latter approach is particularly useful for
tab-based applications, where each tab can maintain its own set of dialogs and auxiliary windows, similar to
how modern web browsers isolate dialogs and popups per tab.

`TOP_LEVEL` windows are created in a separate `Stage` and are integrated with the operating system's windowing environment.

Despite their different implementations, both `NESTED` and `TOP_LEVEL` windows are accessed through the same API.
As a result, components built on top of `Window` (such as dialogs, wizards, or utility windows) can be displayed
either inside the application or in separate system windows without any changes to application code. This allows
window-based components to be implemented once and reused with any window type.

### Tab <a name="core-tab"></a>

`Tab` is an abstract component used for creating custom tab implementations. In ShellFX, `Tab` is one of the central
platform components, since the primary application functionality is delivered through tabs.

`Tab` can be added to any component that implements the `TabContainer` interface. The platform
provides two components that implement this interface: `TabHost` and `TabDock`, where `TabDock` extends `TabHost`.

### Page <a name="core-page"></a>

`Page` is a component that represents a titled, selectable element. A key feature of this component is its lazy
initialization. For example, if a container displays one of N `Page`s, only the `Page` that the user actually chooses to
view will be initialized.

`Page` can be added to any component that implements the `PageContainer` interface. The default implementation of
this interface is `PageHost`.

### Dialog <a name="core-dialog"></a>

`Dialog` inherits `Window` and is a specialized component designed for user interaction and result acquisition.
Since `Dialog` inherits `Window`, it can be displayed in any environment that supports windows and uses the same
API as regular windows.

All dialogs in ShellFX are asynchronous. Opening a dialog does not block the application's execution flow or freeze
the user interface. Instead, user responses are delivered through callbacks, events, observable properties, or
other asynchronous mechanisms. This approach keeps the UI responsive and simplifies background processing.

Dialogs can be displayed either as `NESTED` or `TOP_LEVEL` windows. Nested dialogs are rendered within a
`WindowContainer` and appear as an integral part of the application's user interface. Top-level dialogs are displayed
in a separate `Stage` and are integrated with the operating system's windowing environment.

Nested dialogs can be displayed in any implementation of `WindowContainer`. The platform provides two implementations:
`HostWindow` and `HostTab`. This allows dialogs to be associated either with a window or with a specific tab.
For example, in a browser-like application, each tab can maintain its own set of dialogs and auxiliary windows,
isolated from all other tabs.

### Popup <a name="core-popup"></a>

All `Popup`s in ShellFX are inline and have a scope that affects what will be blocked when the `Popup` is open.

Inline `Popup`s are components that appear embedded within the current application window, typically overlaid on top
of the existing content. They are contextually tied to a specific section (e.g., a `Shell` or `Tab`) and do not
create a separate OS-level window. In contrast, modal window `Popup`s (or native `Popup`s) open as standalone
OS-managed windows with their own frames and system controls, completely independent of the parent UI.

There are two types of scope: `Window` and `Tab`. `Popup`s in the `Tab` scope are bound to a specific tab and are visible
only while that tab is open. `Popup`s in the `Window` scope are global to the `Window` and remain visible even when all
tabs are closed.

`Popup` can be added to any component that implements the `PopupContainer` interface. The platform provides two
components that implement this interface: `Tab` and `Window`.

### Area <a name="core-area"></a>

`Area` is an abstract base component that represents a rectangular region. Naturally, `AreaFxView#getNode()` returns a
`Region`.

## Layout Components <a name="layout"></a>

Layout components are responsible for arranging `Tab`, `Page`, and, in some cases, `Area` components and their derivatives.

### TabHost <a name="layout-tab-host"></a>

`TabHost` is the primary component that can contain `Tab` components; therefore, it implements the `TabContainer` interface.
This component provides all the necessary APIs for working with tabs — adding, selecting, removing, transferring
tab ports, and more.

### DockHost <a name="layout-dock-host"></a>

`DockHost` is the main component of the docking layout and one of the most complex components in the platform.
Before describing how it works, let’s examine its child components.

`TabDock` extends `TabHost`, meaning it can contain tabs. In addition, it introduces docking-specific functionality
such as dragging an entire `TabDock` from one layout position to another, collapsing it into a `SideBar`, and
similar behaviors.

`SideBar` is a component that displays collapsed `TabDock` instances. It is important to note that a `SideBar` can
be shown even when it contains no collapsed `TabDock` components, using `SideBarPolicy`. This is useful when the
`SideBar` is intended to host additional UI elements besides collapsed `TabDock`s.

When a `TabDock` is minimized to a `SideBar`, any of its minimized tabs can be previewed in a `TabPopup` component,
which allows its width to be resized.

In addition to defining the layout structure, a `DockHost` can have a main component. The main component is intended
to host the primary application content, while `TabDock`s typically contain auxiliary tools and supporting
components. The main component can be any `Area`-based component and is specified in the model using
`ModelNodeBuilder#mainArea(...)`. The defining characteristic of the main component is that it remains part of the
docking layout for the entire lifetime of the `DockHost` and cannot be minimized to a `SideBar`. When a main
component is present, it is used as the reference for determining the target `SideBar` when minimizing a `TabDock`.

If no main component is defined, `DockHost` falls back to determining the target side based on the position of the
`TabDock` within the docking layout.

Now that the components are introduced, let’s outline how everything works together. `DockHost` provides two
complementary APIs for working with docking layouts.

The first is the whole-tree API, which is intended for complete layout construction, restoration, and serialization.
A docking layout is described as a `ModelNode` tree. Each node represents either a group or a leaf component. Group
nodes (`GroupNode`) define the layout orientation (`HORIZONTAL` or `VERTICAL`) and their children, while leaf nodes
(`AreaNode`) contain `Area`-based components displayed in the workspace. An immutable model tree is created using
`ModelNodeBuilder` and applied to `DockHost` using `Composer#applyModel(GroupNode)`. The current layout can be
captured as such an immutable tree using `Composer#captureModel()`. This approach is recommended when initializing a
workspace, restoring a previously saved layout, or persisting the current layout state.

The second is the partial-tree API, which is intended for incremental runtime modifications. Instead of rebuilding
the entire layout, it performs targeted operations relative to an existing anchor component. This API is used for
operations such as adding a new area next to an existing area, replacing a component, removing a component, or
performing docking operations initiated by the user. Anchors are addressed the same way as in the whole-tree API —
via `ModelNode` — but obtained live from the current layout using `Composer#getModelNode(AreaFxView)` rather than
built by hand. A node obtained this way is not a snapshot: navigating it via `ModelNode#getParent()` or
`GroupNode#getChildren()` always reflects the layout's actual current state, which lets an anchor be resolved to any
ancestor group regardless of nesting depth.

### PageHost <a name="layout-page-host"></a>

`PageHost` is a simple component that displays `Page` components and performs their lazy initialization.
It can be used to display navigable pages with a flat menu-like structure in diffent components - tabs, dialogs etc.

### TreePageHost <a name="layout-tree-page-host"></a>

`TreePageHost` is almost identical to `PageHost`, except for the menu structure: `PageHost` uses a flat menu
(`ListView`), whereas `TreePageHost` uses a hierarchical menu (`TreeView`).

## Shared Components <a name="shared"></a>

Shared components are auxiliary components built on top of Core components and used by components from other modules.

### FindBase <a name="shared-find-base"></a>
`FindBase` is an abstract base search component that contains the entire search view implementation, including both
submit search and instant search functionality. Since child components may be of different types (toolbar, panel, etc.),
this component includes only minimal CSS styling. It is important to note that this component does not contain any
logic for executing the search itself. At the same time, the base `*FindPort` interfaces are provided without
implementations.

### FindPanel <a name="shared-find-panel"></a>
`FindPanel` is an abstract class for find panels that are placed at the bottom of other components. It is important
to note that this component does not contain any logic for executing the search itself.

## Dialog Components <a name="dialog"></a>

In this section, the dialogs from the `dialogs` module are described. This module contains implementations of the most
commonly used dialogs.

### AlertDialog <a name="dialog-alert"></a>

`AlertDialog` is a dialog for common user notification scenarios such as informational messages, warnings, errors,
and confirmation requests.

### FileChooserDialog <a name="dialog-file-chooser"></a>

`FileChooserDialog` is a dialog for selecting a file when opening or saving. The dialog type is defined using the
`FileChooserType` enumeration.

It is important to note that this dialog works with files provided by classes from the `storage` module. This makes
it possible to use the dialog with virtually any file storage implementation, provided that an appropriate `FileStorage`
implementation is supplied.

### NameValueDialog <a name="dialog-name-value"></a>

`NameValueDialog` is a simple dialog for displaying name–value pairs. The parameter name is shown in a `TextField`,
while the value is displayed in a `TextArea`.

## DevTools Components <a name="devtools"></a>

DevTools components are tools for inspecting and analyzing the application at two levels: the component tree and
the JavaFX scene graph. They are primarily intended for developers building components on top of the platform.

### DevToolsTabDock <a name="devtools-tab-dock"></a>

This component is a container for `Tab` components and provides shared tab management mechanisms. It can be added to
any layout, whether a simple layout or a docking layout.

### ComponentTab <a name="devtools-component-tab"></a>

This component allows exploring the tree of active components and inspecting their properties. In addition, it
provides information about the class hierarchy of the selected component.

### NodeTab <a name="devtools-node-tab"></a>

NodeTab is an interactive inspector for the JavaFX scene graph. It allows developers to explore the node hierarchy,
inspect JavaFX properties, and modify supported property values at runtime without restarting the application.
The component also enables opening reference documentation (Javadoc) for both classes and their properties.

When working with JavaFX properties, the right panel provides the ability to inspect property values and edit them
using dedicated dialogs, which can be opened by right-clicking a `Property` in the panel.

`ViewDialog` displays the full value of a property. This is particularly useful when the value is too long to fit
within the property table.

`TextEditorDialog`, `EnumEditorDialog`, and `InsetsEditorDialog` allow editing different types of properties.
`TextEditorDialog` supports properties whose values can be represented as text (such as `Number`, `Boolean`, `String`,
and similar types), `EnumEditorDialog` is intended for properties backed by enumerations, and `InsetsEditorDialog`
is used for properties of type `Insets`.

Being able to modify property values without restarting the application greatly simplifies debugging and makes it
much easier to experiment with and determine the appropriate values for JavaFX node properties.

### EventTab <a name="devtools-event-tab"></a>

This component allows recording node events. It can operate with or without filters. Events can be filtered by
selected component, message, event type, and other criteria.

### StylesheetTab <a name="devtools-stylesheet-tab"></a>

This component allows inspecting which stylesheets are applied to nodes within the scene.

### EnvironmentTab <a name="devtools-environment-tab"></a>

This component provides access to platform settings, system properties, and environment variables.

## Extension Registries <a name="registries"></a>

An extension registry provides a runtime mechanism for components, plugins, and modules to contribute functionality
without introducing direct compile-time dependencies between them. Extensions can be added or removed at runtime, and
registrations may occur in any order.

### Control Registry <a name="registries-control"></a>

`ControlRegistry` stores UI control contributions — menus, menu groups, and menu items — as `ControlFactory`
instances, keyed by the target component's own view class rather than by any per-component identity. A `MenuName<V>`/
`MenuGroupName<V>` carries both a compile-time view type `V` — checked against the registered `ControlFactory<V, ?>`
so a factory built for the wrong component is rejected at compile time — and a runtime `getComponentClass()`, which
is the class the registration is filed under. Registrations can be added or removed at any time and in any order,
which is what makes the registry safe to use with dynamically loaded plugins. A `ControlFactory` is not invoked
eagerly; it only runs once its contribution actually needs to be materialized.

Resolving the controls that apply to an actual component instance walks that instance's own class, its superclasses,
and its interfaces, matching each against registered component classes — so a slot filed under a base view type
(e.g. `TabHostFxView`) is automatically picked up by every subtype (`TabDockFxView`, and so on), without either side
needing to know about the other in advance. The resolved set is cached, keyed by `Class#getName()` rather than by
the `Class` object itself — holding the `Class` would also hold a strong reference to its defining `ClassLoader`
and, transitively, everything else a plugin module loaded through it, leaking the whole module after it is meant to
be unloaded. The cache is invalidated on every registration change, so it can never observe a stale set.

`ControlRegistry` has no built-in notion of "the" main menu — `registerMenu`, `registerMenuGroup`, and
`registerMenuItem` are the only entry points, and every registration is scoped by whichever `MenuGroupName`/
`MenuName` it is registered under. Building Shell's own menu bar out of this is just one particular use: a caller
like `DefaultShellFxView` picks a `MenuGroupName` to treat as its bar's root, registers/receives menus under that
group like any other, and passes the same group to `ControlBuilder#buildMenus` when assembling. Since nothing here
is main-menu-specific, one registry can just as well back several independent menu bars, each keyed by its own
group.

`ControlRegistry` itself never assembles a final UI control; it only stores the metadata needed to build one later.
Assembly is the job of `ControlBuilder`, which reads a registry's contributions for a given component, invokes each
`ControlFactory`, groups and orders the results, and removes empty menus/groups. See [Managed Controls](#managed-controls).

## Managed Controls <a name="managed-controls"></a>

A managed control is a regular JavaFX control (`Menu`, `MenuItem`, `ContextMenu`, etc.) augmented with two things:
identity/positioning metadata (a name, a position, an owning group) and pluggable behavior attached separately from
the control itself, through a `Handler`. Behavior is kept off the control's own class hierarchy for two reasons.
First, `Menu`, `MenuItem`, `CheckMenuItem`, and `RadioMenuItem` already form a fixed single-inheritance hierarchy
that managed types must extend directly, leaving no room to also extend a shared behavioral base class. Second, a
`Handler`'s lifecycle methods (`onUpdate`, `onShowing`, `onHiding`) are dispatched by the platform through JavaFX's
own `onShowing`/`onHiding`/`onAction` properties; if handler logic were expressed through those same properties
directly, code that called `setOnShowing`/`setOnAction` on a managed control would silently override that wiring
instead of failing loudly.

### Managed Menu <a name="managed-controls-menu"></a>

The managed-menu primitives live in the `material` module, independently of `ControlRegistry`/`ControlBuilder`:

* Menu — `ManagedMenu`, `ManagedMenuItem`, and `ManagedContextMenu` are the actual controls. `ManagedMenu` and
`ManagedMenuItem` extend their JavaFX counterparts and add a name and a position. `ManagedContextMenu` extends
`ContextMenu`, which has no `visible` property of its own, so it adds one — this is what lets a `ContextMenuHandler`
decide whether the whole popup should be shown at all, the same way a menu-level `MenuHandler` can decide a nested
menu's visibility.
* Group — `ManagedMenuGroup` has no JavaFX equivalent; it exists purely so that items contributed by
independent, mutually unaware sources can still be visually clustered and ordered together within one menu, with
groups separated from each other by a separator. A group that ends up with no visible items, and the separator
around it, are both hidden — see Manager below for how that stays correct as contributions change at runtime.
* Handler — `Handler` declares `onUpdate`/`onShowing`/`onHiding`; `MenuItemHandler` adds `onAction` for leaf
items. `MenuHandler` and `ContextMenuHandler` attach to a `ManagedMenu`/`ManagedContextMenu` respectively and decide
that control's own visibility directly, without knowing anything about its children — which matters because a menu
assembled from independent, mutually unaware contributors cannot know its own contributors in the first place.
`AbstractHandler`, `AbstractMenuHandler`, `AbstractMenuItemHandler`, and `AbstractContextMenuHandler` provide the
common no-op defaults.
* Manager — `MenuBarManager` wires a `MenuBar`: it dispatches `onAction` (disambiguating a mouse click from a
keyboard accelerator, since the same key combination can fire an item whether or not its menu is currently open),
resolves visibility on showing (a menu with its own `MenuHandler` decides for itself; one without derives its
visibility from whether at least one of its own items ends up visible, recursively), collapses separators around
sections that ended up empty, and reacts to items being added or removed after the menu bar was already built and
shown, since contributions can change at runtime. `ContextMenuManager` does the same for a single
`ManagedContextMenu`, minus the accelerator disambiguation a one-off popup does not need.

These primitives do not depend on `ControlRegistry`/`ControlFactory`/`ControlBuilder` at all — a `ManagedMenu` tree
can be built by hand and handed straight to a `MenuBarManager` to get dynamic, handler-based behavior. The registry
and builder solve a different, additional problem: composing contributions from many independent, mutually unaware
plugins into one such tree in the first place. See [Control Registry](#registries-control) for that part.

## Naming Convention <a name="naming-convention"></a>

ShellFX is built on top of PatternFX and fully conforms to its patterns. Because of this, the naming of classes and
interfaces for components follows a consistent scheme:

1. A unique name (may be omitted for brevity) — `Alert`, `File`, `Info`, etc.
2. The component role — `Tab`, `Window`, `Popup`, `Area`, `Panel`, `ToolBar`, etc.
3. The component element — `View`, `Presenter`, `FxView`, `Params`, `Port`, `History` etc.

Examples: `AlertDialogFxView`, `EditorTabPresenter`, `InfoPopupParams`, `ToolBarPort`

This approach is justified by the following reasons. When a complex component is split into multiple components
(due to complexity, reuse of components, or use of a docking layout), there may be several components with the same
unique name but different roles — such as `FooTab` and `FooArea`. Another reason is that the role of a component
immediately makes it clear how to work with it and where to place it.

When working with `Composer` methods, there are two categories of methods:

1. Methods that create/destroy a component and compose/decompose it. It is important to note that these methods
manage the component lifecycle, meaning they are responsible for component initialization and deinitialization.
Such methods include: `open*`, `close*`, `show*`, and `hide*`.

2. Methods that only compose/decompose a component. These methods are responsible solely for structural component
composition and do not manage the component lifecycle. Such methods include: `add*`, `remove*`, and `replace*`.

Examples of `Composer` methods using `open*` and `close*`:

| Component | Create + Add         | Remove + Destroy      | Add Only            | Remove Only            |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Window    | `openWindow(params)` | `closeWindow(window)` | `addWindow(window)` | `removeWindow(window)` |
| Tab       | `openTab(params)`    | `closeTab(tab)`       | `addTab(tab)`       | `removeTab(tab)`       |
| Dialog    | `openDialog(params)` | `closeDialog(dialog)` | `addDialog(dialog)` | `removeDialog(dialog)` |
| Popup     | `openPopup(params)`  | `closePopup(popup)`   | `addPopup(popup)`   | `removePopup(popup)`   |
| Page      | `openPage(params)`   | `closePage(page)`     | `addPage(page)`     | `removePage(page)`     |
| Area      | `openArea(params)`   | `closeArea(area)`     | `addArea(area)`     | `removeArea(area)`     |

`View` methods also follow a naming convention that distinguishes two kinds of methods:

1. State methods — methods that mirror state owned by the `Presenter`. The `Presenter` has the corresponding state and
a `getX`/`isX` and/or `setX` accessor for it. The corresponding `View` method always starts with `update`, e.g.
`updateTitle`, `updateModal`, `updateDensity`.
2. Command methods — all other methods that perform an action rather than mirror `Presenter` state. They use an
appropriate action verb, such as `showX`, `hideX`, `scrollToFile`, `selectFile`, `clearX`, or `refreshMenu`.
